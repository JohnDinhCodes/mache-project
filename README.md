# Mache Project

## What is this project?

The Mache Project is where I took a template from [SYMCU.CO](https://symu.co/) and convert it to a static website from scratch

## What was the purpose of this?

Testing my skills to create a full static website using PostCSS with the BEM architecture, 
as well as making it completely mobile-responsive, and testing responsive images
