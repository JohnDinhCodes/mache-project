# Mache Project

## What is this project?

The Mache Project is where I develop [SYMCU.CO](https://symu.co/)'s photoshop design and converted it to a static website from scratch

## Summary

In this project, I used PostCSS with the BEM architecture.
The end result is a completely mohbile-responsive website
